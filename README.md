# Rust Learning Lab

A personal project repository designed to reinforce and demonstrate my Rust learning journey through structured, real-world-inspired tasks.  
This lab complements the [Ultimate Rust Bundle Course](https://www.ardanlabs.com/training/individual-on-demand/rust-bundle/) by **Herbert Wolverson**, published via **Ardan Labs**.

> ⚠️ This repository and its tasks are **not part of the official course**, but are **independently designed** for deeper understanding and practice.
