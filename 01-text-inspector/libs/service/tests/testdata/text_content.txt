Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.

Unlike C and C++, Rust guarantees memory safety without a garbage collector, thanks to its ownership system.

Rust empowers developers to build reliable and efficient software — from low-level embedded devices to high-performance servers.

Rustaceans (Rust users) enjoy a rich ecosystem, strong type system, and excellent tooling like Cargo and Clippy.

Concurrency without data races? That’s Rust.
